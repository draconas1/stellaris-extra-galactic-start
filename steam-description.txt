[h1]Start in an Isolated Extra-Galactic Constellations.  (3.2)[/h1]
This mod takes the excellent constellations from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1523039190]Extra Galactic Clusters[/url] and makes it possible to have any of them as a starting location for your civilisation (Note only the Constellation, not the contents).  You can also spawn the other EGC's for your civ to later find and explore.  

It is done via a new Origin: Extra-Galatic Cluster.
If your civilisation takes that then a menu will appear on game start for you to customise your cluster.  The AI never will. 

[h1]Options[/h1]
[list]
[*] Constellation Shape
[*] Starting  System Initaliser (Sol, Deneb, Random, Ring World, Starborn)
[*] Guarantee that strategic resources and specific stars for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Giagastructures[/url] will spawn
[*] Access to your cluster? (Wormhole, Many Wormholes, the L-Gate Network)
[*] Spawn all the clusters from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1523039190]Extra Galactic Clusters[/url], and optionally link them in an extra-galatic wormhole ring or to the L-cluster.
[*] Multiplayer support for upto 2 players to start in clusters
[*] If nobody takes the origin you can still spawn all the other clusters using an edict
[/list]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Your civilisation will move into its new cluster home on day 2 to avoid issues with galaxy generation.  Select your options then start time, the game will freeze and lag while it generates the cluster, which might take a while on large galaxies, be patient, it will start.  
 original point in the galaxy where the evidence of their passage was left.

Your constellation will not have precursors.  If you want to learn about your precursor civilisation you will need to get back to your
You can Experimental Subspace Navigation your science vessels to your old home system (and L-Gates if selected), that is deliberate.  Be warned the AI expands towards your home cluster quickly as it has a glut of nice planets and resources.

If you select for the rest of the Extra Galatic Cluster to spawn in they will spawn in over time in the first year, to avoid galaxy generation issues.  This means you will get lag and freeze spikes until about August when the last one, Hexagon, spawns.  Hexagon spawns at the edge of the addressable universe so you may need to hide the outlier to select it.

This mod was also inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1796380598]Isolated Cluster Start[/url]

In multiplayer Player 1 should take the regular EGS origin, player 2 should take the "Mulitplayer EGS" origin.  See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1999512770/1751275263836781191/]here[/url] for details.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
No vanilla files were harmed in the making of this mod, but as it does a lot of work shifting a colony will have issues with other mods that do the same or things that add planet classes at starting

[list]
[*]This mod is incompatible with things that change the planet/system start, there is a long description why in the discussions section
[*]Supports [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743133825]Starborn[/url] Habitat starts, for an improved Voidtouched starting.
[*]It is compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url] planet starts, except for tidally locked.  It will cheerfully ignore the PD "habitable planets to be same type instead of exact match" option.  
[*]Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guillis Planet Modifiers[/url].

[h1]HELP!  I DIED ON DAY 1[/h1]
This is most frequently caused by a modded species home planet, I have to code every home planet manually.  If you are a non vanilla, non planetary diversity planet type for your homeworld preference then I can't set it when you move.  Post a comment letting me know the planet type and which mod it came from and I'll add it.  

[h1]Bug Reporting[/h1]
The only way to achieve a lot of the effects is with a large amount of copy and paste code, so if you have a bug I really need to know the following information, even something so trivial as Spawning Kerbals or not falls down an entirely different branch of the cluster generation and so may have bug where the non kerbals don't.[list]
[*] What cluster you started with
[*] What your starting world was
[*] Whether you have gigastructures stars enabled and the Kerbals enable
[*] What class your original starting planet was 
[*] What other mods are you using
